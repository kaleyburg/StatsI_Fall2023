econdf <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv", header=T)

#plot just to see
plot(econdf$reserved, econdf$water)

#now fit linear regression model
summary(lm(econdf$reserved~econdf$water))
#or (hannah told us this is better practice)
summary(lm(reserved~water, data=econdf))

#saving as an object
model <- summary(lm(reserved~water, data=econdf))
model

#making p value easier to read
#got all of this from tutorial script
sprintf("%.20f",2e-16)

#coefficient value is 0.0018240
#equation would be 0.0018240X + 0.3028613
#0.3028613 is the intercept
#this means that for every 1 increase in X, the expected
#average increase in Y is 0.0018240
